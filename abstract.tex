Mobility simulations are important for the operations of mobile communication networks. They aim to investigate how moving subscribers affect the underlying core network. Usually the mobility models behind this simulations are derived from stochastic processes or surveys. A different approach is to derive this mobility model from real world subscriber information. Therefore, network operators can make mobility simulations with their own subscriber behavior.

Within the scope of this thesis, a system to estimate driving trajectories for subscribers in cellular networks will be presented. The estimated driving trajectories can then be used in mobility simulation frameworks .The developed system investigates handover updates in the network operator’s core network. Since handover events only expose a coarse location information, an approach to estimate the handover position based on coverage prediction maps will be delineated. The developed system utilizes population density maps to estimate the start and end position of the subscriber’s journey. The estimated trajectories covers the traveled route as well as timestamp to derive the subscriber’s velocity.
