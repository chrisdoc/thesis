  abstract = {Drivers have available an increasing number of options for informing
	themselves about the current traffic state and to subsequently make
	route choice decisions based on this information. Governments are
	investing heavily to build and operate variable message signs (VMS),
	drivers are buying navigation systems that show the current traffic
	state, and thirdparty providers are setting up systems that give
	information about the traffic state via Internet or phone. To evaluate
	public investments particularly, it is necessary to know how this
	information affects route choice behavior. Analyses were made of
	route choices in two study areas equipped with VMS that give recommendations
	for routes. The influences of VMS, broadcast traffic state, and other
	factors are evaluated by using maximum likelihood estimations. A
	unique feature of the analyses is the large database of observed
	route choice decisions, which are extracted from mobile phone trajectories.
	The total number of observations analyzed for this paper amounts
	to 1.4 million.},
